## üöÄ Features (v.1.4.7)

- **Written in x86_64 Assembly:** No dependencies, maximum speed and control.
- **Iterative Deepening with Aspiration Windows:** Smarter root search for best move.
- **Transposition Table (TT):** 1 million-entry hash table for fast position lookup.
- **Zobrist Hashing:** Fast and robust position identification.
- **Full Static Exchange Evaluation (SEE):** Superior capture ordering, tactical blunder avoidance.
- **Pawn Promotion:** Both white and black pawns can promote to Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight.
- **Opening Book (stub):** Ready for binary opening book integration.
- **Comprehensive Move Generation:** Knights, bishops, rooks, queens, kings, pawns, including all captures and promotions.
- **King Safety Evaluation:** Assesses king zone for threats.
- **UCI Output:** Prints the best move in standard UCI format (`bestmove g1f3`).
- **No external libraries needed:** Just NASM and LD.
